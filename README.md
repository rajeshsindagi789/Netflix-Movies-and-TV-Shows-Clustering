# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
Project Summary -
This project aims to analyse and cluster a Netflix-related dataset. The dataset includes a number of characteristics linked to Netflix films and television series, including runtime, rating, genre, title, and release year. The objective is to investigate trends and overlaps in the content that is accessible on the platform and organise them into significant clusters.
The dataset will first undergo preprocessing, which includes resolving missing values, eliminating irrelevent columns, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations. Techniques for feature engineering can also be used to extract value out of the available attributes.

After that, methods for exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be applied in order to obtain understanding of the dataset. Statistical summaries and visualisations will be utilised to comprehend the variable distribution, spot patterns, and investigate correlations between various features.

Clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based spatial clustering will be used once the dataset has been extensively examined. These algorithms will combine films and TV series from Netflix that are similar in terms of their qualities.We'll use methods like silhouette analysis and the elbow approach to figure out the ideal amount of clusters.

Following clustering, an analysis and interpretation of the data will be conducted.We'll examine the clusters to determine the traits and trends that each group has in common. In terms of content acquisition tactics and content classification, Netflix will find this investigation to be quite informative.

In the end, a brief and understandable summary and presentation of the clustering analysis's results will be provided. In order to effectively explain the project's outcomes, graphs, charts, and visualisations will be employed.

To sum up, the project's objectives are to examine a Netflix dataset, apply clustering algorithms to put related TV series and films in one group, and offer conclusions based on the clustering findings. The effort will facilitate Netflix's decision-making processes and improve comprehension of the company's content environment.
